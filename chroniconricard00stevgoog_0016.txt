RICHARD ΟΡ CIRENCESTER.

IN the year 1757, Mr. Bertram, an Englishman
then in the service ol the King of Denmark,‘published
at Copenhagen, in a duodecimo volume, along with
Gildas and Nennius, a short historical treatise on Great
Britain, ascribed to Richard of cirencester, who was a
monk of Westminster. As the date at which Richard
is supposed to have lived would, in the order os time,
require his work to appear immediately aster Gildas,
NeuniuS, and Beda, the Council of the English Histo-
rical Society think it right to explain to'the Members
the grounds upon which they have abstained, at least
lor the present, from presentiug them with this treatise
ol Richard as a genuine work.

It would appear srom Stukeley’s account of the
work, printed at London in 1757, that the publication
took place in the following manner. In June 1747 a
letter was received by Stukeley from Charles Julius
Bertram, professor ol the English language in the
Royal Marine Academy at Copenhagen. The letter
seems to have been written the year before, but Mr.
Bertram till then hesitate'd about transmitting it.

This letter led to a correspondence between Stuke·
ley and Bertram; and Stukeley says that in its pro-
grcss “Mr. Bertram mentioned a manuscript, in a

“ friend's hands, ol Richard ol Westminster, being a
“history of Roman Britain, which he 'thought a great
“ curiosity, and an ancient mapol the island annexed.'’
