copy of this work, which is preserved in the
Corpus Manuscript cccxxxix, the Editor· is un·
able to conjecture upon what grounds it is ascribed
to Richard of Devizes, from whose history of
Richard the First it differs materially in style
aud arrangement. The name of the author, who
appears to 'have been a monkel Wiuchester, had
been expressed in a marginal note, now unfor-
tunately mutilated hythe binder3 what remeius
shows that the work was dedicated to ono Master
Adam. An anonymous monk of winchester,
who wrote a history ol that see, embodied a
considerable portion of this General Chronicle in
his “ Breviarium chronicorum,''¹ without af-
iordingany information as to its origin.²

It only remeius for the Editor to express
his thanks to the Reverend John Lamb, D.D.,
Master of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge,
sor permission to collate the manuscript copy
of Richard’s Chronicle now deposited iu the va*-
luable Library belonging to that Collega.
