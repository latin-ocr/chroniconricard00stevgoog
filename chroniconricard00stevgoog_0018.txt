RlGHARD OF cIRENcnsTER.

“ fide collegi aliorum verba et relationes qnae sincera
“maxume deprehendi et lide dignissima !’'-p. 55.

'l'he whole history of this alleged work therefore is
extraordinary. Richard himself anticipates objections
to his work, and apologises for any mistakes he may
be found to have committed. 'l'his is unusual. The
words containing the Roman general's consignmcnt
of his fragments to posterity are also remarkable.
What is most suspicions of all is, that although it
was so little to be expected that an original manuscript
relating to English history should fall into the hands
of an Englishman at copenhagen, and though Ber-
tram himself obtained possession of it in a manner
which he himself calls marvellouS, he has neither told
ns in what the marvellousness consisted, nor has the
manuscript ever been seen by any person bnt Bertram
himself 3 nor has he toldus to whom the manuscript
belonged, where it was deposited, or any other circnm-
stance relating to it.

The Council have requested a very intelligent Danish
- gentleman, who has lately returned from this country
to Denmark, to make all the inquiry he can about the

manuscript which Bertram is supposed to have copied.
From his researches some light may be thrown npon
this controverted subject; bnt as so mnch doubt still
hangs over the authenticity of Richard’s work, the
Council hope the Members will think them justified
in abstaining from giving it a place among the re-
ceived materials of English history.
