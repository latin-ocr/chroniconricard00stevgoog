Stukeley says, “ Ι then began to think ot' the
“ manuscript, and desired some little extract from it;
“ then an imitation of the handwriting, which Ι showed
“to my late friend Mr. Casley‚ keeper in the Cotton
“ Library, who immediately pronounced it to be four
“hundred years old.'’—pp. 12 and 13.

Stukele'y adds, “I pressed Mr. Bertram to get the .
“ manuscript into his hands if possible, which at length
“with some difficulty he effected ; and on my solicita· ¹
“tion sent to me in letters a transcript of the whole,
“ and at last a copy of a map, he having an excellent
“ hand in drawing.’'

This is all which Stukeley, according to his own
account, ever knew of the alleged manuscript. The
account which Bertram gives of the manuscript in
p. 2 of his prefaoe to the printed work, is as follows:
“ Ordine inter eos primus est RicarduS, qui, licet ipsius
“opusculum, quod inter curiosa alia bene multa miro
“modo mihi in manus venit, non in omnihus suis ahso-
“lutum sit numeris, non tamen ad infimam historiarum
“mediae aetatis classem est referendus''

Ι In the work itself the two following passages -
occur:

“ Ex fragmentis quibusdam h Duce quodam Ro-
“ mano consignatis et posteritati relictis, sequens col·
“lectum est itinerarium, ex Ptolemaeo et aliunde non-
“nullis ordinem quoque (sed, quod spero, in melius)
“mutatum hincinde deprehendes.”-p. 35.

“ Veritatem, quoad fieri licuit, sectatus fui. Si quid
“ occurrat forte, illi non exacto congruum, illud mihi ne
“ imputetur vitiove vertatur rogo. Me enim ad rcss
“gulas legesque historiae solicite componens ea bona
