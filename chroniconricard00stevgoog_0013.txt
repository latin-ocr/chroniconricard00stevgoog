aaa? 3¹⁰ § 2. These facts, taken in connexion with others
'¹⁰⁰’ mentioned in the work, enable us to form some
conjecture as to the time when it was written,
Robert, Prior os Winchester, was removed· from
that place to Witham in 1191 ;¹‘ consequently this
Chroniclo was commenced in, or after that year.
‘The tone oi thc' whole composition, and the man·
ner in which King Richard, John Earl ol Mor·-
taine, and others are mentioned, lead to the con-
clusion that it was written before 1199, when John
suoceeded his brother on the throno of England.
· Itis consequently anterior to the Chronicles ol
Diceto and Hoveden; and may bo considered as
one of the earliest and most authentic narratives
of the reign of Richard the First.
ι 10¹1 ω §a Its merits as an historical document are
Η ’ considerable. It records the original observa·
·tions ol an acute contemporary, who may be
,presumed to have had g'ood authority for the
¹assertions which he advances. His statements
aro generally corroborated by other early and
independent writers oi respectability3 and his
reflections, although sarcastic, are at least can·
did, and apparently uniniluenced by party spirit'.
His style, as an historian, is greatly injured' by ,
the parade ol classical allusions and quotations
in which hc pedantically indulges himself 3² and
the speeches which he puts into the mouths of
his actors are of more than questionable authen·
ticity. But it may be safely asserted that, viewed
either as an historian or as a writer, the publi-
cation of his Chronicle forms a valuable addition
to our early national literature. ’
