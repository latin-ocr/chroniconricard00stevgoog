'PREFAGE TO RICHARD 01² DEVIZES.

§L Tun following pagos give an account mm ,f
-of the affairs of England from the year 1189 until ”W
1192, and of the exploits of King Richard the
First, during that time, in the Holy Land.

Of Richard of Devizes, the author of this mmm
Chronicle, nothing is known beyond the inci- ”W
dental allusions to himself which occur in the
Prologue to the present work. During his re-
sidence at Winohester as a rnonk of the Priory
of St. Swithin, he had formed a close intimacy
with Robert the Prior of that house3 to whom, ’
after his removal to the Charter-House of Wi-
tham,l our author paid a short visit, in order,
as he quaintly expresses himself, to see how
much nearer Heaven was the newly founded
establishment of the Charter-House, than was
Winchester. The circumstances which attended
his visit are obscurely hinted at3 but we may
' infer that, in consequence of some disagreement
among those monks by whom he was accom-
panied thither, it was not of long duration.
Upon his return to Winehester he composed the
following historical work, which he dedicated to
his friend the Prior ofWitham, as well for the
purpose of weaning his affections from the trans-
itory glories of this life, as of presenting him
witha memorial of their mutual friendship.
